                <p>I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. My family moved to Massachussetts when I was in the 8th grade.
                  I went back and fourth throughout highschool, my oldest sister still lived in Brooklyn at the time. New York is my first
                  home. I love New York, the people, the scenery, the art that's all around me. It is beautiful.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p><strong><u>My Passion:</u></strong> I love art. I love design. I love drawing or painting or even just building and constructing. I
                  love everything that has to do with art. All the different types of hues, shapes, textures. Words, I love the art of writing and the
                  brilliance in bringing words to life. All types of art is my true passion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p><strong><u>Fun fact:</u></strong> Even as a natural born New Yorker I love being in nature. I love the serenity factor, I love the
                  trees and flowers. I love the lakes and trails. I love being one with nature. I mean, I am still very much a city girl at heart
                  I love the crowd and the interactions and meeting people, but the peaceful moments are what I cherish most.</p>
